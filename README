***IMusicModel & MusicModel***
-MusicModel is the model for the MusicEditor project.
-It contains 4 fields which are a music object used to store music notes, the duration of the music
 in beats, the highest pitch in a music and lowest pitch in music.
-IMusicModel has 7 methods for user to use.
  1.get(int, int) can return the longest note stored at the music by given beat
    and pitch. However, the structure of storing notes in music object is 3-dimensional.
    Giving beat and pitch (2 parameters) can only find the list of notes. There is no way to get
    a specified note if there are 2 or more in a list(a note overlaps on another).

  2.add(Note) can add a new valid note to the model.

  3.remove(int, int) can remove the longest note stored at the music by given beat and pitch.
    Same as get, there is no way to specified which note to be removed if the list has 2 or more
    notes in a same beat and pitch.

  4.edit(int, int, Note) can edit the longest note at the given beat and pitch and replace it with
    a new Note.

  5.combineSimultaneously(IMusicModel) can combine 2 music pieces together and can be played
    simultaneously.

  6.combineConsecutively(IMusicModel) can attach a new music piece to the
    end of origin music piece.

  7.print() can print the music model out in String.

***Pitch***
-There are 12 pitches in a octave. For the convenience, I combine the octave and the pitch index
 together. For example, middle-C (C4) is 48th pitch in my music model.

***Note***
-Note is an object has a starting time which represents which beat it should start to play,
 the duration of this note which represents how long it should play, the pitch represents the pitch
 of this note, the instrument represents what kind of instrument should use to play this note and
 volume represents the volume of this note.

***Music***
-Music is an object to keep all the notes in it. It can be seen as a 3-dimensional coordinate which
 x-axis is the beat, y-axis is the pitch and z-axis the note.
